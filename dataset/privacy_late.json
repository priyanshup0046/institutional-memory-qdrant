    "core_reasoning": [
      "Rejection of Talismanic Shields: The Court reasons that 'National Security' is not a talisman that grants the State total immunity from judicial scrutiny; the State must demonstrate a specific nexus to security when fundamental rights are at stake.",
      "Technological Due Process: In the absence of State transparency on complex digital matters, the Court adopts an 'active oversight' stance, utilizing independent expert committees to verify facts rather than accepting vague executive denials.",
      "Informational Self-Determination: The reasoning establishes that the right to privacy includes control over one's digital afterlife; the permanent discoverability of outdated or prejudicial data is seen as an affront to Article 21 dignity.",
      "Constitutional Chilling Effect: The Court reasons that untracked surveillance compromises the independence of democratic institutions (press and judiciary), moving the harm of privacy violations from the individual to the collective constitutional fabric.",
      "Temporal Limitation of Public Interest: The interpretive stance holds that the 'public interest' in information is not eternal; once the legal or social necessity of data expires, the individual's right to move on takes precedence."

    "arguments_accepted": [
      "Insufficiency of Omnibus Denials: The argument that a 'limited affidavit' from the State is an inadequate response to prima facie evidence of high-tech surveillance.",
      "Right to Erasure/De-indexing: The claim that the permanent nature of the internet requires judicial intervention to mask identities of acquitted persons or parties in sensitive matrimonial disputes.",
      "Privacy as a Democratic Prerequisite: The argument that without privacy, the freedom of speech (Article 19) is functionally destroyed by self-censorship and fear."
    ],
    "arguments_rejected": [
      "Executive Supremacy in Security: The State's argument that the judiciary lacks the competence or jurisdiction to question the methods used for national intelligence.",
      "Open Justice as Absolute: The argument that the 'Open Justice' principle requires court records to remain permanently indexed and searchable by the public, regardless of the prejudice caused to the individual.",
      "Waiver by Prosecution: The argument that by being an accused in a public trial, a person permanently loses their right to control their identity in the digital public square."
